We are living in the age of pandemics, where taking care of personal and loved ones health is the most important. Today during the pandemic situation, the need to buy products online has become a necessity, and for small-scale vendors like grocery or medical stores or any such small shops, it becomes difficult to setup an online portal to sell their products.
Our Objective is to build a platform that can be easily used by small-scale vendors to configure and get a unique URL for their shops, so that the end customer can purchase through online and get the goods at their DoorStep.


Welcome! we hope you enjoy the site as much as we enjoyed making it.

# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
